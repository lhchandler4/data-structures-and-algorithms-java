# Graph Implementation
- Implement a graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Challenge
- Should be able to add a node to the graph. Adds a new node to the graph, Takes in the value of that node, Returns the added node.
- Add an edge to the graph. Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph, Include the ability to have a “weight”, Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge, Both nodes should already be in the Graph.
- Get all of the nodes in a graph. Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar).
- Get all the neighbors of a node. Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node, takes in a given node, Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection.
- Get the size of a graph. Returns the total number of nodes in the graph.
