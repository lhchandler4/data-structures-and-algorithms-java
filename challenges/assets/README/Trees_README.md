#Trees
- Implement a Tree

## API
1. Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

2. Create a BinaryTree class. Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

3. Create a BinarySearchTree class. Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

4. Create a method (in the BinaryTree class) that will traverse and print the values of a tree on a breadth first basis
