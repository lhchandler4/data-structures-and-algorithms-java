#PseudoQueue
- Implement a Stack data structure that behaves like a Queue

## API
- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Big O
- Enqueue has a O(1)
- Dequeue has a O(n)
