# Singly Linked List
Linked Lists are a data structure that offer certain advantages over array lists

## Challenge
The challenge was to create three methods. Insert, Includes, Print

## Approach & Efficiency
Insert has a big O of 1. Includes has a big O of n. Print also has a big O of n.

## API
1. insert will insert a new not with a given value which is an integer to the beginning of a linked list

2. search will return a boolean based on whether your linked list includes the value that was inputted

3. print does not take in any values but returns the values of all the nodes in a linked list

## Solution
- [Linked List Code](../../src/main/java/Java/LinkedList/LinkedList.java)

- [Linked List Test](../../src/test/java/Java/LinkedListTest/LinkedListTest.java)
